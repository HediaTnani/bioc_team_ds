# R/Bioconductor Data Science bootcamps

In order to have a common set of external references and R knowledge that we use for the [Data Science guidance sessions](#data-science-guidance-sessions) as well as our work, we have a series of R and Bioconductor bootcamps. Most of the material these bootcamps are based on is freely available or can be purchased for a small fee. Thus, we can feel confident that our LIBD and JHU collaborators will be able to access the material, as well as really anyone else in the world.

## Team bootcamps

The first iteration of these bootcamps were run on September 2020 with the following schedule. For all of them, you should have the latest R and RStudio versions installed in your computer and be familiar with the R programming language. You will probably need to spend time self-learning and practicing some of the material beyond these videos.
