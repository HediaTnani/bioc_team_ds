**TODO**: some type of anonymous automatic weekly report that pulls data from our session logs, might use GitHub Actions & R Markdown websites to build it

## Become a DSgs guide

Non-team members are welcome to join the [DSgs-guides](#dsgs-guide-team-members). This involves a significant time commitment (~ `r round((4 * (25 + 15 + 10) + 30 + 2 * 60) / 60 + 0.5, 0)` hours per week) and you need to discuss this with your supervisor. These commitments are:

* helping others through DSgs sessions ~ `r 4 * (25 + 15 + 10)` minutes per week ^[We recommend four 25 minute sessions, each with 15 minutes of preparation and 10 minutes of post-meeting wrap up.]
* a weekly 30 minute meeting as explained in [DSgs: feedback](#dsgs-feedback)
* attending the LIBD rstats club (1 hour per week)
* time for self-learning and/or building common resources (~ 1 hour per week)

Additionally, we might have some additional training sessions.

Some potential advantages are:

* access to all our training material, explained in detail at [DSgs-guides](#dsgs-guides)
* a common structure for helping others at LIBD/JHU
* recognition through our DSgs session reports
